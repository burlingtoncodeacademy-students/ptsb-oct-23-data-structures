/*
    ? Class Methods
    * method is a function that lives inside of a class
    * can be used on any class instance
*/

/*
    ? Class Inheritance
    * extends a parent class with a child class
*/

/*
    ? Static Fields
    * typically properties that do not need to change as you create instances
    * do not require instantiation with a new operator
    * create an instance of our class through its method
*/

// Since a dog is always a pet we don't need to change it for each new Dog instance we create
// Notice that this isn't using a key/value with a colon
// Static fields must be the first thing in a class if they need to be declared
// Remember that classes are not objects but templates for them
// In a class this is how it expects the template to be designed vs what an object expects

// You can only use strings, numbers, falsy values (null, undefined), or nothing (see line #140)
// Objects with no value when assigning are undefined

/*
  ? Private Fields
  * Syntax: ???
*/

// Challenge
// Research private fields with Javascript classes
// Create a private field named type with a value of pet
// Create a new instance of Dog and change the private field value to something new
// What do you think happens aft? What reasons might we want private properties?
