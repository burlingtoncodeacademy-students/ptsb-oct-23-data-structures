# PTSB Oct 23 - Unit 3: Data Structures

### Setup

The setup will be the same each week.

- Install the Colorful Comments extension in VS Code if you don't have it already to enable syntax highlighting for easier readability
- Clone the repository to your local and copy the files for that night's lesson to your personal folder

### Unit Files

- Arrays & Methods (arrays.js, arrays-methods.js)
- Objects & Methods (objects.js, objects-methods.js)
- Classes (classes.js, classes-methods.js)
- State Machines & OOP Design (state-machines.js, oop.js)

Challenges are included within each file. They will sometimes be completed during the lessons and the ones that are not are highly suggested to take on yourself out side of class to build your skills. Answers can be found in files named as `{file}.answers.js`.

## Lessons
#### Before
The unit files will be available before the lesson and will include sections per topic w/ useful information. They will not contain the code-along examples, notes, or challenges.

#### During

The files will be presented via screen share for each part of the lesson and filled in as a code-along. Fill in your file as you write your code w/ your instructor.

#### After

The final version of each file will be pushed to the repository after the lesson is complete. Challenges and answers will all be pushed by the end of that lesson's day.
