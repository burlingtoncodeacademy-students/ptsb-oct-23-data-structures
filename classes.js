    ? Classes
    * templates or blueprints for creating objects
    * they encapsulate data with code
    * JS is a prototype-based langauge with access to OOP principles
    * Class are NOT hoisted
    * Classes are considered special functions. They can be defined as:
        * class declarations
        * class expressions

*/

// ? Class Declaration
// * Syntax: class {ClassName}
// * Parameter: n/a
// * Classes are always capitalized

// Classes look similar to objects using curly braces but they are not
// Consider them templates for objects that you will later create
// Constructors is a special method that create/initializes an object created by a class (1 per class)
class Learner {
  constructor(name, city, cohort) {
    this.name = name;
    this.city = city;
    this.cohort = cohort;
    this.scholarships = 7500;
  }
}

// ? Create a new instance
// We create our instance, aka instantiation of the class, and pass in properties designed in our class's constructor
const bob = new Learner('Bob', 'Chicago', 'ptsb-oct-23');
const kelly = new Learner();

console.log(bob);
console.log(kelly);

/////////////////////////

// & Challenge #1
// In the constructor if there if the name is NOT 'Sammy', throw an error

// ! Answer
// ! Your answer here

/////////////////////////

// ? Prototype Chaining
// Consider the "instance" again, it's a clone more or less of its parent class which is why typeof below logs object
// Class = template for objects, instances = objects created by using the class following the template
console.log(typeof bob);
console.log(bob instanceof Learner);
console.log(bob instanceof Object);
console.log(bob instanceof Object);

// ? Accessing object instance values
// We can access, add, and update things just like our previous lesson
bob.scholarships = 10000;
bob.graduated = 'in progress';
console.log(bob);

// ? Class Expression
// Remember this no different than assigning a variable
// Were assigning a class to our House variable
const House = class {
  constructor(address, bedrooms, bathrooms) {
    this.address = address;
    this.bedrooms = bedrooms;
    this.bathrooms = bathrooms;
  }
};

let LakeViewEast = new House('1007 Orange St', 3, 2);

// ? Named Class Expression
// Equivalent to the above but has a name that can be referenced
// Think about how a function can also be declared similarly - function(){} or function getHome(){}
const apartment = class Apartment {
  constructor(address, bedrooms, bathrooms) {
    this.address = address;
    this.bedrooms = bedrooms;
    this.bathrooms = bathrooms;
  }
};

let Mila = new House('1007 Orange St', 3, 2);

console.log(LakeViewEast);
console.log(Mila);
